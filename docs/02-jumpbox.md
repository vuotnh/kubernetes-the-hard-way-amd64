# Set Up The Jumpbox

In this lab you will set up one of the four machines to be a `jumpbox`. This machine will be used to run commands in this tutorial. While a dedicated machine is being used to ensure consistency, these commands can also be run from just about any machine including your personal workstation running macOS or Linux.

Think of the `jumpbox` as the administration machine that you will use as a home base when setting up your Kubernetes cluster from the ground up. One thing we need to do before we get started is install a few command line utilities and clone the Kubernetes The Hard Way git repository, which contains some additional configuration files that will be used to configure various Kubernetes components throughout this tutorial. 

Log in to the `jumpbox`:

```bash
ssh root@jumpbox
```

All commands will be run as the `root` user. This is being done for the sake of convenience, and will help reduce the number of commands required to set everything up.

### Install Command Line Utilities

Now that you are logged into the `jumpbox` machine as the `root` user, you will install the command line utilities that will be used to preform various tasks throughout the tutorial. 

```bash
apt-get -y install wget curl vim openssl git
```

### Sync GitHub Repository

Now it's time to download a copy of this tutorial which contains the configuration files and templates that will be used build your Kubernetes cluster from the ground up. Clone the Kubernetes The Hard Way git repository using the `git` command:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 \
  https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way.git
```

Change into the `kubernetes-the-hard-way` directory:

```bash
cd kubernetes-the-hard-way
```

This will be the working directory for the rest of the tutorial. If you ever get lost run the `pwd` command to verify you are in the right directory when running commands on the `jumpbox`:

```bash
pwd
```

```text
/root/kubernetes-the-hard-way
```

### Download kubectl
Download kubectl binary version v1.31.2
```bash
cd ~
wget https://dl.k8s.io/v1.31.2/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl
```

### Install kubectl

In this section you will install the `kubectl`, the official Kubernetes client command line tool, on the `jumpbox` machine. `kubectl will be used to interact with the Kubernetes control once your cluster is provisioned later in this tutorial.

Use the `chmod` command to make the `kubectl` binary executable and move it to the `/usr/local/bin/` directory:

```bash
  chmod +x kubectl
  cp kubectl /usr/local/bin/
```

At this point `kubectl` is installed and can be verified by running the `kubectl` command:

```bash
kubectl version --client
```

```text
Client Version: v1.31.2
```

At this point the `jumpbox` has been set up with all the command line tools and utilities necessary to complete the labs in this tutorial.
